This is a CSS snippet that alters the appearance of queries for the \[Tasks Plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

I adapted [sunb-mn's Minimal Tasks Theme](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/1962). Thank you to sunb-mn for sharing!
